# Backpacking MPPT Solar Charger
Solar charger designed to charge lithium ion cells directly, bypassing USB charging circuit.  

## Features

Advantages of this design:
* Very high efficiecy buck converter
* Psuedo MPPT tracking using BQ24650 chip
* Intergrated power meter and battery charge status
* Passthrough charging to charge device and battery simultaneously
* Integrated battery attachment for simple attachment to pack while hiking
* Adjustable to different panel voltages
* Avoid 2 stage voltage drop to cells for higher total efficiency (solar -> battery vs solar -> USB -> battery)
* Magnetic battery contacts designed to avoid reverse polarity connection
* Compatability with both Nitecore NL2150RX and Vapcell P2150A
